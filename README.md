### Project Overview 🌍  
You have been hired to develop a responsive front-end interface for a blogging application that interacts with an existing API. The platform will allow users to browse dynamic blog posts while providing an admin interface for managing content. The application includes features such as a carousel for recent posts, a responsive grid layout for easy navigation, and an intuitive post management system for the blog owner.

This project is for The Mediterranean Dream, a travel-focused blog aimed at inspiring readers to explore the Mediterranean's diverse culture and beauty.


### Client 🌴  
*  **Name**: The Mediterranean Dream
* **Sector**: Travel
* **Size**: 1 Blogger
* **Location**: Preferably somewhere in the Mediterranean, but based in Oslo, Norway
* **Mission**: To inspire travelers by sharing captivating stories and insights into the Mediterranean’s diverse beauty, culture, and hidden gems. We aim to connect readers with authentic experiences and encourage them to explore the Mediterranean’s unique destinations and traditions.

### Key Features ✨  
* **Design & Tools**:  
  The user interface was first designed in **Figma** to ensure a modern, user-friendly experience. For blog post creation and editing, the application integrates the **TinyMCE** rich text editor, allowing intuitive and flexible content management.

* **Blog Feed Page**:  
  Features an interactive banner carousel showcasing the 6 latest posts, with clickable buttons and interactive dots for navigation. Additionally, a responsive grid layout presents the 12 most recent posts, allowing users to search, filter by tags, and easily browse through posts. The grid also includes pagination to view more posts beyond the initial 12.

* **Blog Post Public Page**:  
  Provides a responsive layout featuring the post title, author, publication date, banner image, and full content. Each blog post is easily shareable, with URLs containing a query string or hash that includes the post ID.

* **Admin Functionality**:  
  A secure login and registration system ensures that only authorized users (the blog owner) can access admin functionalities. The admin has full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities, allowing efficient management of blog posts through a validated form and integration with **TinyMCE** for seamless content creation and editing.

* **Accessibility & WCAG Compliance**:  
  The website follows **WCAG** guidelines with clear labels and error messages for forms, ensuring users can easily understand instructions and correct mistakes. It uses semantic HTML for compatibility with various browsers and assistive technologies like screen readers. The layout is fully responsive, providing an optimized experience across all devices. Accessibility checks, including contrast, are performed using tools like **WAVE** to ensure the site meets high accessibility standards.
